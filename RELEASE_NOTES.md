## What's New in 2026.2.5-2
### UI & Design
- **Dashboard Hero** — Refreshed the hero section with a slightly more modern layout and visual feel.
- **Group Images** — Group images now open in an inline viewer inside VRCNext instead of launching an external browser window.
- **Media Library — Improved Layout** — The gallery now extends to the full height of the screen, matching the Inventory tab behavior. No more early cutoff at the bottom.
- **Media Library — Fade Effects** — A smooth theme-colored fade now appears at the bottom of the gallery at all times, and fades in at the top once you have scrolled down past the first section — keeping the layout clean and polished.

### Window & Navigation
- **Drag Region Expanded** — Both the Menu Sidebar and the Friends Sidebar can now be used to drag the application window, in addition to the existing center drag area.

### Friends & Social
- **Mutual Network** — New tool under Tools that visualizes your entire friend circle as an interactive force-directed graph. Nodes represent friends, edges connect two friends who are mutual with each other. The graph reflects live online status via colored status rings. Supports zoom, pan, drag-to-pin, and click-to-focus. Right-clicking a node opens the standard context menu.

### Context Menu
A right-click context menu is now available in several places throughout the app:

- **Friends List — Friend Entry** — View Profile, Send Invite, Request Invite, Join, Unfriend, Mute/Unmute, Favorite/Unfavorite, Send Invite with Message.
- **Friends List — Your Profile** — Quickly switch your status between Online, Join Me, Ask Me, and Do Not Disturb, or open your own profile.
- **Friends List — Instance Info** — Favorite the current world or open the world modal directly from the instance row beneath your profile.
- **Worlds Tab & Dashboard** — Add a world to favorites, remove it from favorites, or open its detail modal.
- **Groups** — View a group, leave a group, or create a post (visible only when you have post permissions).
- **Mutual Network Canvas** — Right-click any friend node to access the same friend actions available in the friends list.
- **Profile Modal — Mutuals** — Right-clicking a mutual friend in the profile modal now opens the context menu.
- **Add Friend** — When right-clicking a user you are not yet friends with, a "Send Friend Request" option is shown instead of the friend-only actions.
- **Cross-modal stacking fixed** — Opening a friend profile from within the group member list or mutual cards now correctly displays on top of the parent modal.

### Interactions & Feedback
- **Notifications Panel** — Clicking outside the notification panel now automatically closes it.
- **World Favoriting Confirmation** — When favoriting a world, a breadcrumb notification confirms the action — e.g. *"World saved to group Favorites"*.
- **External Links** — Specific links now open in the system's default browser instead of within the app.

### Group Management
- **Delete Group Posts** — A delete icon is now shown on group posts when you have group management permissions, allowing posts to be removed directly from the feed.
